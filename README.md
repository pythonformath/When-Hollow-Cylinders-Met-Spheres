# When-Hollow-Cylinders-Met-Spheres
Two rotating hollow cylinders and two two spheres where user can control size, spacing, RGB coloring. Language for html, css, javascript.  
I am not quite sure how this started. I need to create a hollow cylinder inside a sphere, so a light beam can go through. I have used Meta AI , it gave me some answers until now. Two cylinders are rotating. PLus two spheres, I need to set up the light beam now. Wish me happy coding!
